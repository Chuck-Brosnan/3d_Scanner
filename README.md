# 3d_Scanner

This program is awful, but sections may prove useful to anyone using the TOF10120 distance sensor, or PCA9685 LED controller (in servo applications).

Written in C for Nvidia Jetson Nano. This is a program for converting distance sensor readings into 3d geometry and displaying on screen.
